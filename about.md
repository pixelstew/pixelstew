![My mugshot](../images/mugshot.jpg){: .about__image }

I'm Rob Gilbert, a front-end developer at [Shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk). 

I live in Essex in the UK with my beautiful ladyfriend and my 3 kids...They're alright too.

At Shelter we are just embarking on a complete site redesign which is pretty exciting. I'll be talking about some of the things I learn through this process right here.

Add me on twitter or email me about whatever - I'm always up for a chat.
